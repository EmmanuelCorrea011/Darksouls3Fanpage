      <p class="body-jefes fs-5">Bosses in Dark Souls 3 are powerful foes which constitute some of the most challenging experiences in the game. Most are defeated as part of the mandatory story progression, with the rest optional. Defeating a boss earns the player souls, restoration of Ember and unique Boss Souls which can be transformed into powerful Weapons, Spells, or Items via Soul Transposition from Ludleth of Courland in Firelink Shrine. 

        Certain bosses feature special NPCs available as summons for the fight, with some of these summoning instances dependent on meeting certain progression conditions. See the individual boss pages for NPCs available and their conditions. 
        
        As long as the respective boss of an area remains alive, a player may be invaded by hostile phantoms. Once the boss is slain, invasions are no longer possible, however players may continue to summon phantoms via the Red Sign Soapstone.
        
        In total there are 19 bosses in the whole game, with 6 of them being optional.</p>

            <iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/575YkIJSk24" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="col-12" ></iframe>

            <p class="body-jefes" id="scrollspyHeading1">Iudex Gundyr is a Boss in Dark Souls 3. He is the first boss that players will encounter. This Dark Souls 3 Iudex Gundyr Guide features locations, strategies and videos on how to defeat Iudex Gundyr easily, as well as tips, weaknesses, trivia and lore notes for the Iudex Gundyr boss.
            As a beginning boss, Iudex Gundyr has a lot of telegraphed attacks that can be consistently sidestepped, dodged, or parried, allowing players to get used to the game's unique combat mechanics. Iudex Gundyr is weak to Fire Damage - and so it is recommended that players make use of the Firebombs they obtain in the tutorial area to defeat him quickly.
            Bosses are unique and challenging Enemies that drop Boss Souls capable of being transformed into powerful Weapons, Spells, and Items for the player.
            Iudex Gundyr is a large humanoid clad in heavy armor and attacks the player using a large halberd. Players will find a sword embedded in his chest when they first encounter him. After being brought down to a certain health threshold, a giant black mass emerges from his neck that gives him access to additional attacks. This boss is not optional and the player will have to face him in order to gain access to Firelink Shrine.</p>


        <h2 class="p-3 text-center fs-1">VORDT</h2>

            <iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9qKEPxPcapg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" class="col-12" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <p  class="body-jefes" id="scrollspyHeading2">Vordt of the Boreal Valley is a Boss in Dark Souls 3. He is the second boss that players will encounter. This Dark Souls 3 Vordt of the Boreal Valley Guide features locations, strategies and videos on how to defeat Vordt of the Boreal Valley easily, as well as tips, weaknesses, trivia and lore notes for the Vordt boss.

            Vordt of the Boreal Valley is a large quadrupedal creature wearing heavy knights armor and many of the attacks in his moveset features a great hammer that resembles a mace. When players encounter him, he is seen walking out of an orb of fog. After being brought down to a certain health threshold, the blue mist around him and his weapon intensifies, slowly inflicting Frostbite onto the player if they stand close to him. This is the first instance of frostbite the player may encounter in the game.
            
            Due to his slow attacks, it is recommended to stay underneath and behind him to and dodge to create opportunities to counterattack. There are 2 phantom NPCs that can be summoned for this boss fight - the Sword Master (if he has been defeated outside Firelink Shrine) and Lion Knight Albert (if Emma is alive). This boss is not optional and he must be defeated in order to be able to progress to the Undead Settlement.

        <h2 class="p-3 text-center fs-1">CURSE-ROTTED GREATWOOD</h2>
            <iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yX3MSBKvlnU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" class="col-12" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <p  class="body-jefes" id="scrollspyHeading3">Curse-Rotted Greatwood is a Boss in Dark Souls 3. This Dark Souls 3 Curse-Rotted Greatwood Guide features locations, strategies and videos on how to defeat Curse-Rotted Greatwood easily, as well as tips, weaknesses, trivia and lore notes for the Greatwood boss.

            The Curse-Rotted Greatwood is a giant tree with human-like limbs. It is covered in sacs that act as the hitbox of the boss. When the player encounters it, they will find a couple of undead in the arena that will fight alongside it during combat. After being brought down to a certain health threshold, instead of going through a transformation, the battle arena changes. This massive tree is filled with curses, and is the object of worship for the Undead Settlement's inhabitants.
            
            Players should find the Mound-Makers covenant before defeating this boss, or they will need extra steps to enter the covenant. It is recommended to bring a weapon with long reach to deal with the Curse-Rotted Greatwood quickly. This boss is optional, but must be defeated for the Transposing Kiln required for Soul Transposition.

        <h2 class="p-3 text-center fs-1">CRYSTAL SAGE</h2>
            <iframe width="800" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QNQsfaa2Ydw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" class="col-12" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            <p  class="body-jefes" id="scrollspyHeading4">Crystal Sage is a Boss in Dark Souls 3. This Dark Souls 3 Crystal Sage Guide features locations, strategies and videos on how to defeat Crystal Sage easily, as well as tips, weaknesses, trivia and lore notes for the Crystal Sage boss.
            The Crystal Sage is a large humanoid covered in loose sorcerer's robes and wears a mage's hat big enough to cover their face. They mainly cast spells using a magical orb, but may attack players that get too close to them with their rapier. Players should be alert when approaching their arena as the boss fight starts as soon as they enter. After being brought down to a certain health threshold, the boss will start spawning clones that resemble themself very closely, save for the difference in the color of their magic.
            Speed is key in this boss fight - knowing how to manage your Stamina can make fighting this boss easier. You can summon Eygon of Carim after saving Irina of Carim to aid you in combat. His summon sign appears behind a pillar in the room immediately prior to the Crystal Sage fight. This boss is not optional and they must be defeated to proceed to the Cathedral of the Deep. Not to be confused with the mini-boss version located in the Grand Archives.
